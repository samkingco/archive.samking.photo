subtitle: Learning by making products for myself
date: 2016
intro: In my spare time, I like to make little products for myself. Usually they're just for learning, sometimes they're useful! Here's a couple of things I've made but not released in the last 18 months or so.

  ## Habits

  I wanted to start forming better habits, but most habit trackers are either crazy complicated, or far too limiting in what you can track. I figured I mostly had two types of goals; amount based, and time based. I made this little app around those two types. You either increment a counter, or start/stop a timer.

  Having daily and weekly goals also gave me flexibility when ramping up to a new habit, instead of setting ridiculous goals right off the bat. I also liked the idea of keeping a tab on streaks to reinforce positive behaviour, but it was hard to do without making myself feel bad about missing a day.

  ## Spot list

  When I travel, I usually have a huge list of things I want to see. I wanted a nice way of keeping track of all the places I planned on visiting, and what I actually got round to doing. I built a very basic version on the plane to New York using Underscore templates. When I got home, I improved the design, but never got round to building the newer version. I also took a lot of inspiration from [Rizon](/design/rizon) in terms of colour palette and overall style.

  ## Note keeper

  Most note apps just drop you in to your list of notes, but I found myself constantly adding new ones instead of viewing old ones. I made this simple app to add new notes quickly. You're always dropped into the new note screen instead. I also wanted a way to tag notes with just hashtags for easier organisation.
